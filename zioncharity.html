<h2><center> What is the Solar Water Project?</center></h2>
<blockquote cite="https://www.bondheshams.org/?gad_source=1">
The OASIS BoxTM brings a submersible water pump, life-saving bacteria filters, and unique data tracking system into a single, transportable unit. Each Box can be deployed in 7 minutes (on a water source) and provides up to 10,000 liters of 99.9% bacterial free clean water daily for years. This is enough drinking water for 5,000 people every single day.
</blockquote>

Since 2014 they have served more then 466 million cups of clean water, have 183 community water projects, and are active in 5 countries at the moment. 
<ul>The 5 countries they are located in:
	<li> South Sudan

	<li> Pakistan
	<li> Afghanistan
	<li> Yemen
</ul>
